# README

This repo contains the code to follow Drifting Ruby's Hotwire tutorial -> https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/hotwire

The code contained is a bit different from the one in the video because the installer scripts and syntaxes have changed slightly since the release of the screencast.

The JS part at the end was initially not working due to some syntax shenanigans. I've left a comment about it in app/views/comments/new.html.erb
